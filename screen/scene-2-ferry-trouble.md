Port of Spain Ferry Terminal
Hustle,heat,and plenty bacchanal
Soca remix of "Sweat"by Inner Circle & Bunji Garlin(playing from someones Bluetooth speaker)
Visuals:
Big crowd , Hot sun. Long lines. Everyone sweating and vex.
Jerry(Dad) holding all 8 tickets and a bag of homemade sandwiches.
Jada's suitcase burst open on the ground. Undies all over.
Joshua and Christon taking turns fanning themselves with laminated ferry passes.
Someone's granny trying to push in the line, telling security she's pregnant.
Dialogue:
FERRY GUARD(annoyed)
"Yuh could only bring ONE bag per person,not ten bossman"
JERRY(charm turned on)
"Bigman, that bag is for the baby. This one for the cooler. This one for...ah medicine."
GUARD(folds arms)
"And the other six?"
TIKI(from behind Jerry)
"One for the chicken!"
(chicken clucks inside a feed sack)
ADALIA(annoyed)
"This sun makin' my wig sweat glue off. Hurry up nah."
JAYDEN(cool as ice)
"This is the part where we suffer before we shine> Classic montage setup"
JADA(eating sandwich)
"Yuh ever taste curry on a white bread when yuh angry? Is like theraphy"
Polt Points:
The family is almost denied boarding of excess bags.
Young Jerry sneaks behind the office and helps "reset the system" (aka,unplugs it and plugs it back in).
They finally board-barely-but the chicken escapes and causes chaos on the boat.
Everyone ends up laughing and soaked in chicken feathers by the end of the scene.
Music Cue:
As the ferry pulls away, wide drone shot of the Port with sun rising.
Vibe shifts from tension to joy as steelpan fades in
