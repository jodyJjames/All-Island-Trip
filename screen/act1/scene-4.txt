Bambbo Teeth & River Bones
Between old hunting path and overgrown bamboo tunnel
Late afternoon
TONE: Curious, grounded, a little eerie-trasition from exploration into the mystical
##Visual Opening:
Crickets chirp , Shafts of sunlight stream through the trees. 
The group walks single file along an overgrown hunting trail. They pass wild sugarcane and thick vines.
Jayden leads with a cutlass, pushing vines aside. Everyone is sweaty, breathing hard, but still excited
CHRISTON(pointing at something in the bush)
"Eh eh , yuh think this from a hunter or somebody livin out here?
ADALIA(screamimg)
"could be an old cocoa worker trail. See that bottle neck? Thst recent.
LITTLE JERRY(excited)
Look! I see something shiny!
He digs in the dirt and pulls up an old rusted spoon. He grins like it's treasure.
BIG JERRY
"Yuh go carry forest spirit back home, yuh know."
JADA
(looking ahead)
"That bamboo tunnel look like.... teeth"
JOSHUA
(holding up his phone)
"No signal. Compass goin crazy."
TIKI(grinning)
"That mean we close. Thats the shortcut to the coast Uncle show me long time"
Jayden steps toward the tunnel first. The bamboo forms a curved arxh over the path. Everyone follows.
[EXT. BAMBOO TUNNEL-MOMENTS LATER]
Sound drops. Wind whistles through the hollow bamboo . Footsteps soften on the leaves. The group keeps close.
JAYDEN
Keep yuh heads down. Watch yuh step.
JADA(pointing to a rock)
Look. Scratches.
She kneels and traces spiral marks carved into a flat stone.
ADALIA
Low...left...river bones under here.
CHRISTON
River bones? What dat supposed to mean?
ADALIA
My granny say when a river dry up, what dead inside still there waitin'.
They walk deeper into the green tunnel, swallowed by the forest's whisper.
