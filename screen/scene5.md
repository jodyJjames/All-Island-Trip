wide aerial shot of the forest canopy at twilight. The camera slowly descends through the mist and trees until we're at ground level. Crickets chirp, the forest is alive wirh energy.

[Dialogue & action]
Jayden(walking with flashlight):
"Yo...this the spot Uncle June said have spirits?"
Christon(grinning):
"He also said them spirits love rum and a good beat."
Joshua(serious)
"Nah,but for real...allyuh feel that? The air different here."
The crew walks deeper into the bush. Flashlights flicker. Fireflies blink in rhythmic pulses. Trees seem to lean inward. They pass an abandoned stone hut.
Adalia (nervously):
"We sure we not lost?"
Tiki:
"We not lost . The app says we on trail."
Young Jerry(pointing):
"Look! What's that glowing by theriver?"
[MYSTICALENCOUNTER] 
The group approaches a small river bend, were the water glows faint neon blue. Bioluminescent frogs leap. A strange tribal carving glowson a nearby stone.
Jada(whispers):
"Is that...a map?"
Jerry(touches the stone):
"No.Is ah warning."
Suddenly the wind stops. Everything is silent. From the shadows, a faint voice sings in patois. The group turns. Nothing is there.
[THE MOMENT]
FLASH-
a vision/hallucination hits Jerry.
He sees flashes of:
An old woman stirring a pot
A boy running through the forest
A bright red bird landing on his healing
It vanishes
Jerry(breathing hard):
"WE have to follow the river. There's something waiting."
Jayden:
"What did you see?"
Jerry:
"Everything.And nothing.Comeon."
They move forward.
[Transition]
Music rises. The camera follows the group along the glowing river bank.
Fireflies circle above them like stars. The screen fades out as their voices echo
