# Scene 1 - Arrival
[ext. ISLAND DOCK - DAY]
The sun hits hard. Turquoise waters shimmer. A sleek black speedboat roars in across the bay and comes to a fast stop at the dock.
The crew jumps out one by one:
**Jayden** (17), tall, confident, scanning the horizon.
**Christon** (16), hoodie half-on, always observing.
**Adalia** (16), shades on, phone out, catching.
**Jada** (15), silent and soulful, sketchbook in hand.
**Jerry** (18), shirtless, laughing loud, flexing for no one.
**Joshua** (15), already halfway up a coconut tree.
**Tiki** (12), smallest one, already fixing someone's speaker.
**Young Jerry** (9), running barefoot on the deck, pure joy.
**ADALIA**
(looking around)
This island hot as hell and fine as heaven.
**JAYDEN**
We earned this. Just vibes from here on.
**CHRISTON**
Unless it's a trap. Just sayin.
**JERRY**
(triumphantly)
Island life, baby!
Suddenly, a loud **BOOM** chaos from the hilltop. Everyone freezes. Birds fly out of the trees.
**TIKI**
That didnt sound like a vibe.
The camera pans up to the distant cliffs... and fades to black.
